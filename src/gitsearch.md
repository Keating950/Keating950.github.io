<a href="https://github.com/Keating950/gitsearch" target="_blank">Gitsearch</a> is a simple command line 
program that searches for and clones repos from Github. I wrote the program in Python, developing the interface
in curses and using GitHub's public API for the search and clone features. Given the difficulties of Python 
packaging and dependency management, I aimed to minimize external dependencies; Gitsearch has only one,
the widely used <a href="https://certifi.io">certifi</a> library.
