<p class="main_text">
    My name is Keating, and I'm a programmer with experience in software
    development, data science, and natural language processing/machine
    learning. My favourite languages are Rust and Python, but I'm always
    looking to learn more. Links to some examples of my work are above. To get
    in touch, send me an email <a href="mailto:headmen.synchro_0i@icloud.com"
        id="comms">here</a>. Other work can also be found on my <a
        href="https://github.com/Keating950">GitHub</a>.
